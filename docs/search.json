In practice, this usually refers to the use of airborne or orbiting sensors designed to measure certain properties of electromagnetic energy exiting an object/area (Jensen 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS)\nElectromagnetic radiation is the flow of energy travelling at the speed of light. It encompasses a spectrum that includes visible light, radio waves, and x-rays, among others, which have different scales of wave frequency and intensity (amplitude).\nRemote sensors are often designed to measure a specific band of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the visible light spectrum or near infrared (NIR).\nDifferent materials (physical, biological, chemical) reflect and absorb energy at different points along the spectrum; therefore different sections of the EMS are relevant for different applications. For example, analysing NIR radiation can help to identify vegetation in earth observation data, and even the health or ‘stress’ state of the plant (Tempfli et al. 2009), in ways that just analysing the visible spectrum is unable to.\n\n\n\nWavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum. Source: (Tempfli et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n\nRadiation (usually from the sun) is reflected by an object and this reflected energy is then detected by a remote sensor. However, there are several processes that affect and transform this energy due to interactions with the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere before the energy reaches the sensor. In many cases, scattering of radiation in the atmosphere requires image correction before the data can be used. This process is covered in Section 3.1.\n\n\n\nSurface and atmospheric interactions of radiation.

For example, a single pixel might represent a 10m x 10m area, or a 100m x 100m area.\nSpectral Resolution: the EMR bands that the data is recorded in (e.g. the red, green and blue bands of the visible light spectrum). Hyperspectral data refers to remote sensors that record an almost continuous observation across a range of the EMR spectrum, as opposed to discrete layers for a certain band region.\nRadiometric Resolution: the range of possible values for a raster cell, expressed in units of bits (e.g. 8-bit, 12-bit). Describes the ability of the sensor to differentiate between small differences in energy.\nTemporal Resolution: the frequency at which the data is collected (e.g. every few hours, every 16 days, yearly)"

    "text": "1.2 Application\nThis week’s practical task involved downloading Sentinel data and Landsat data to investigate using QGIS and SNAP software, including the application of a tasseled-cap transformation. The tasseled-cap transformation emerged from the development of spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) using multispectral data from the original Landsat mission, launched in 1972 (Cohen and Goward 2004). SVIs are a key tool in ecological and agricultural monitoring using remote sensing data, having the benefit of greater sensitivity to vegetation phenology (i.e. the periodic changes in plant growth across seasons) than analysis of individual spectral bands (Blair and Baumgardner 1977).\nThe tasseled-cap transformation is an extension of SVIs, first developed by Kauth and Thomas (1976), that is intended to capture spectral characteristics of soil, as opposed to just vegetation. It has been iteratively improved over time following improvements in the quality and availability of Landsat data, and is now commonly derived using three indices: Brightness, Greenness and Wetness (Cohen and Goward 2004; Crist and Cicone 1984).\n\n\n\nAn example of the tasseled-cap transformation indices. Source: [@cohenLandsatRoleEcological2004]\n\n\nTasseled-cap transformation continues to be used in ecological applications, such as classifying forest structure (e.g., Dymond, Mladenoff, and Radeloff 2002) or tree species (Fassnacht et al. 2016), but has also been applied in urban land classification research - for example, in analysis of urban green space and soil characteristics (Ridd and Liu 1998)."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nIn this introduction week, the topics that stood out to me were the ingenuity of the technical aspects, bridging the gap between the physics of electromagnetic radiation and applying this knowledge to produce very powerful and informative datasets. These aspects include the mechanics behind a sensor’s spectral resolution, the translation of images into distributions of pixel values, and the additional considerations of using an active sensor.\n\nSpectral ResolutionPixel DistributionsActive Sensors\n\n\nWhen reading about a sensor, the band range will often be specified - e.g., a sensor may be described to observe the area of the electromagnetic spectrum between 525 - 605 nm (nanometres being a measure of the wavelength). However (and this is quite intuitive when you stop to think about it), the sensor does not actually have such a discrete cut-off at these wavelengths. Detectors are actually sensitive to a region of the EMS, where the maximum sensitivity is at the middle spot of this region, with sensitivity declining as it moves away from this point. The stated range given for sensors uses the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) criteria, which is the range of wavelengths detected at 50% or greater intensity, as shown in the figure below, from (Jensen 2015).\n\n\n\nDefining spectral resolution using the Full Width at Half Maximum Criteria\n\n\n\n\nI found conceptualising a remote sensing image as a simple distribution of pixel values a very powerful way to think about how the data can be analysed, understood, and transformed. A practical example of this is the use of histograms to ‘stretch’ the colours in an image, to improve differentiation and visual interpretation. The histogram of pixel values will commonly follow an approximately normal distribution, but a colour gradient will run linearly from the minimum to the maximum value of the dataset, which will result in a much ‘shallower’ gradient. Different methods can be used to rectify this, such as stretching or clipping to min/max.\n\n\nJensen et al. (Jensen 2015) warn that “powerful active remote sensor systems that emit their own electromagnetic radiation (e.g., LiDAR, RADAR, SONAR) can be intrusive and affect the phenomenon being investigated. Additional research is required to determine how intrusive these active sensors can be.” (p.8). I would be interested to investigate further what kind of research has been done in this area, or what kind of impacts active sensing methods are hypothesised to have. In which situation would the process of using an active sensor disturb the process being observed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair, B. O., and M. F.

The mechanism provides the current temperature in the user’s location, whether or not they are at risk depending on their age and medical condition, as well as how to reach a cooling spot in case they are at risk\n\nStatements from CHO:\n\n“The first and most important goal is to make the city greener and to create an infrastructure that would bring more nature and water into the city … We need to increase the number of parks in Athens that already provide shelter to vulnerable residents. Parks can help a great deal to bring down temperatures in the city; they absorb CO2 emission and retain water, they increase biodiversity, create oxygen, clean the air from microparticles so they also help to fight pollution.” Eurocities News\n\n“The second solution will be carried out in the short-term. The plan is to give wider access to air conditioning to the most vulnerable groups and help them to lower temperatures in their homes during heatwaves. Air conditioning will play a role in this case. We know it increases outdoor heat and CO2 emissions, but it will be necessary to protect people from getting sick or dying.”\n“Together with meteorologists and climate scientists, we are considering naming heatwaves and categorising them like hurricanes. This will make events more prominent in people’s minds, turning weather phenomena into an entity. People are able to think of an event more clearly if they can call it by a name and media can more easily communicate it to their audiences. Categorising heatwaves will help authorities to set up risk management protocols.”"

    "text": "4.2 Application\nPotential applications for remote sensing data have been broken down into the three main strategies outlined by Myrivili above: (1) Increase urban greening, (2) provide relief to the most vulnerable, and (3) improve risk communication.\n\n4.2.1 Increase urban greening\nUsing remote sensing data to monitor vegetation and land cover in urban areas is well-established, and there is a depth of scientific literature to demonstrate this (for example, Zha, Gao, and Ni 2003; Wu and Murray 2003). Through automated classification of surface land use/land cover (LULC) using remote sensing, the city of Athens could directly measure progress towards the goal of 30% land cover being vegetation or permeable surfaces by 2030. Yuan et al. (2007) demonstrate that freely available Landsat imagery would generally provide a sufficient data source for this task.\n\n\n4.2.2 Provide relief to the most vulnerable\nIncluding a dimension of vulnerability into risk measurement suggests the need for data fusion - combining remote sensing data of LULC and surface temperature with spatial socioeconomic data, collected through a population census, government administrative datasets, or research surveys. Johnson et al. (2012) showed that calculating an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI) consisting of census data and remotely sensed imagery was able to explain nearly 80% of the variance in heat-health vulnerability when applied to a heatwave event in Chicago, and accurately captured a trend of higher death rates in high risk zones and lower death rates in low risk zones. A similar approach has been applied by researchers in Birmingham, UK (Tomlinson et al. 2011) to identify the spatial distribution of heat vulnerability.\n\n\n\nFlowchart of incorporating remote sensing hazard data with sociodemographic vulnerability, from Tomlinson et al. (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability risk map of Birmingham, from Tomlinson et al. (2011)\n\n\nIn Athens, these approaches could be used to provide an evidence basis for policy intervention, identifying areas of greatest need for rapid intervention such as installing air conditioning or creating public “cool zones”, and providing subsidies for energy use to address pockets of energy poverty.\n\n\n4.2.3 Improve risk communication\nAs mentioned in the quote and video above (The Policy Context), the City of Athens has proposed naming and categorising heatwave events, in an attempt to improve public awareness of severity and the associated risk. The city has already put this proposal into action, working with the National Observatory of Athens to incorporate meteorological remote sensing data into a digital warning mechanism, that will warn user’s smartphones on heatwaves, factors of risk, and nearby cool zones (Horowitz 2021)."

    "section": "4.1 Summary",
    "text": "4.1 Summary\nHow can remote sensing data be applied to help achieve policy goals?\nCities across the globe are introducing policies and targets to address the growing challenges of climate change, disaster resilience, and sustainability. This case study explores the approach of the Greek capital, Athens, and how a policy to address the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and protect residents from deadly heatwaves could incorporate remote sensing data.\n\n4.1.1 The Policy Context\nIn 2021, the City of Athens appointed a Chief Heat Officer, Elena Myrivili - a European first, and the second globally following a similar appointment in Miami, Florida, in the same year (Harvey 2021). Although a temporary position, Myrivili’s role as Chief Heat Officer was designed to raise the profile of heat as the city’s deadliest climate event, and to coordinate a metropolitan-scale response to building heat resilience - through strategies such as increased green space and urban canopy, adjusting the design of roads and buildings, and improving systems to warn residents during particularly dangerous heatwaves.\nWatch the video below to see Myrivili outline the impacts heat has had on her city, and the broad strategies to combat this.\n\nPolicy goals outlined by the Chief Heat Officer:\n\nIncrease urban greening\n\n\n“The first and most important goal is to make the city greener and to create an infrastructure that would bring more nature and water into the city … We need to increase the number of parks in Athens that already provide shelter to vulnerable residents. Parks can help a great deal to bring down temperatures in the city; they absorb CO2 emission and retain water, they increase biodiversity, create oxygen, clean the air from microparticles so they also help to fight pollution.”\n\n\nProvide immediate relief to the most vulnerable\n\n\n“The second solution will be carried out in the short-term. The plan is to give wider access to air conditioning to the most vulnerable groups and help them to lower temperatures in their homes during heatwaves. Air conditioning will play a role in this case. We know it increases outdoor heat and CO2 emissions, but it will be necessary to protect people from getting sick or dying.”\n\n\nRaise awareness and improve risk communication\n\n\n“We are considering naming heatwaves and categorising them like hurricanes. This will make events more prominent in people’s minds, turning weather phenomena into an entity. People are able to think of an event more clearly if they can call it by a name and media can more easily communicate it to their audiences. Categorising heatwaves will help authorities to set up risk management protocols.”\n\nSource: (Horowitz 2021)\nConcurrently, the City of Athens has also developed a Climate Change Action Plan which feeds into much of the work of the Chief Heat Officer, and includes goals to transition 30% of the city surface to vegetation and/or permeable surfaces by 2030, and in the same time frame ensure that 70% of the city’s populations has access to green space within a 15 minute walk.\nThese goals are reflected in both the regional and global context. Athens is prominently involved in European Union initiatives for urban resilience as a signatory to the European Commission’s Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. In a broader sense, addressing climate change as an impact on health and livelihoods aligns with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, a high-level framework for directing global patterns of development and resilience (United Nations 2022), and the UN Environment Program’s (UNEP) Beat the Heat report, a sustainable cooling handbook for cities (United Nations Environment Program Mon, 11/08/2021 - 14:57)."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis section will cover corrections applied to remote sensing data, to account for atmospheric noise, shadow and distortion, and other processes affecting the raw output. In practice, corrections will most often be dealt with by the image provider - where data is made available ‘analysis ready’. Search source metadata for details on which corrections have been applied, and the calculations used.\n\n3.1.1 Types of Correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction (includes Orthorectification, or Topographic Correction) *CHECK THIS\nAccounts for differences in sensor view angles. Corrections will use methods such as ground control points, where known points are identified in both images. See figure below.\nMaking the images taken straight down (“nadir”) comparable to images from off-centre (“off-nadir”)\n\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nAccounts for the ‘haze’ caused by atmospheric scattering and absorption.\nUsing Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) to quantify the difference between surface reflectance and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.\n\n\nResampling\nAccounts for difference in spatial resolution of raster images. Resampling is used to calculate values for ‘lower’ resolution pixels calculated from the component higher resolution pixels.\nUsed to resample Landsat bands taken at 10m resolution into lower resolution 20m pixels, to allow band math with other bands recorded at 20m resolution. [SPECIFY THE BANDS AT 20; FROM PRAC 1]\n\n\nRadiometric Calibration\nAccounts for the conversion of unitless data collected by the sensor (a ‘Digital Number’) to a value indicating the spectral radiance.\nThe transition from Digital Number to Radiance to Reflectance represents different values corresponding to increasing levels of correction/processing.\n\n\nPoint Spread Functions\nAccounts for the spread of reflectance values that contribute to a single pixel. The centre of a pixel will have the greatest influence on the observed reflectance; point spread functions calculate the influence of pixel sections as distance increases from the centre.\n\n\n\n\nUsing ground control points in geometric correction:\n[INSERT IMAGE FROM NOTION]"

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nWhat is Google Earth Engine (GEE)?\nEarth Engine is a cloud-based application designed for the analysis and exploration of remote sensing data. It provides access to powerful supercomputing resources and an extensive database of freely available remote sensing data, from a variety of sources and sensors. The data in Earth Engine is preprocessed and analysis-ready, and the catalogue is continuously updated with data becoming available on average within 24 hours of acquisition (Gorelick et al. 2017).\nHow does it work?\nAnalysis is divided between a client side - the Earth Engine browser interface - and the server side, where the data is stored and the processing is performed.\nDue to the huge volume of data that can be involved in Earth Engine calculations and visualisations, the system also uses different methods to reduce data load/computing time:\n\nPyramid ScalingLazy ComputationDistributed Computing\n\n\nIn Earth Engine, the spatial resolution is determined by the output, not the input. The system stores a ‘pyramid’ of progressively reduced resolution tiles, which adjust depending on the scale of the user’s view. The smaller (reduced resolution) layers of the pyramid are calculated through a down-sampling method, such as the mean for numeric data, or the mode for classification data.\n\n\n‘Lazy’ computation refers to the process of only computing the data that are necessary, such as that in the user’s current view (if using an interactive display). The window’s zoom level and bounds will dynamically control the projection and resolution of the computed data.\n\n\nThe Earth Engine code library provides a suite of inbuilt functions that are designed to maximise performance on the cloud-based computing system. Methods such as parallelisation and distributed computing break down larger jobs to be run across many smaller machines, allowing faster times to produce client output.\n\n\n\nSource: Gorelick et al. (2017)\nWhat data can I find?\nEarth Engine holds a broad data catalogue, which can be accessed here: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets.\nGorelick et al. (2017) also provide a useful summary table of key satellites and datasets."

    "text": "5.2 Application\nBuilding a remote sensing machine learning pipeline using Earth Engine\nSulova and Jokar Arsanjani (2021) incorporated Earth Engine data into a machine learning pipeline, for the analysis of drivers of wildfire in Australia. This study is interesting because it outlines the full workflow of an open source remote sensing analysis, from the collection and processing of freely available data in Earth Engine to then become an input into a series of machine learning models (random forest, naive bayes, and a classification and regression tree) to identify the most effective. The output of the study is an automated workflow for developing large, labelled training datasets using Earth Engine to be applied in supervised machine learning.\nIn the flowchart below, Earth Engine is used for the extraction and analysis of Sentinel-2, FIRMS, DEM, NDVI and other satellite image collections, in the pre-processing stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiner scale malaria mapping in low transmission settings\nSturrock et al. (2014) have used remote sensing data from Earth Engine in conjunction with routine malaria case data from health facilities to map malaria risk in Eswatini (Swaziland). The researchers used a suite of remotely sensed ecological/environmental covariates, including enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalised difference water index (NDWI), and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), captured by MODIS and sourced from Earth Engine. All covariates were resampled to a 1km resolution and then fed into a hierarchical modelling framework.\nThe study is intended as a proof-of-concept for implementing the methodology in diverse settings. Utilising Earth Engine for the remote sensing aspect means the method can be freely and relatively easily replicated, especially in potentially resource-limited settings."

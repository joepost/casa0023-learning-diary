Some examples include:\n\n\n\nEarth Observation Data Source\nOperator\nApplication Examples\n\n\n\n\nDynamic World\nGoogle Earth Engine (GEE) app, developed jointly by Google and the World Resources Institute.\nReal-time, high resolution (~10m) land cover\n\n\nLandsat\nNASA/USGS\n- Urban/green space coverage - Urban heat island - Illegal logging - Natural disasters (bushfire, flooding)\n\n\nSentinel\nESA (European Space Agency)\n- Pollution - Illegal logging - Urban heat island\n- Oceanic monitoring - Natural disasters\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 What is remote sensing?\nAt its simplest, remote sensing is the collection of data or information about an entity (such as an object or geographic area) from a distance. In practice, this usually refers to the use of airborne or orbiting sensors designed to measure certain properties of electromagnetic energy exiting an object/area (Jensen 2015)."

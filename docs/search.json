In practice, this usually refers to the use of airborne or orbiting sensors designed to measure certain properties of electromagnetic energy exiting an object/area (Jensen 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS)\nElectromagnetic radiation is the flow of energy travelling at the speed of light. It encompasses a spectrum that includes visible light, radio waves, and x-rays, among others, which have different scales of wave frequency and intensity (amplitude).\nRemote sensors are often designed to measure a specific band of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the visible light spectrum or near infrared (NIR).\nDifferent materials (physical, biological, chemical) reflect and absorb energy at different points along the spectrum; therefore different sections of the EMS are relevant for different applications. For example, analysing NIR radiation can help to identify vegetation in earth observation data, and even the health or ‘stress’ state of the plant (Tempfli et al. 2009), in ways that just analysing the visible spectrum is unable to.\n\n\n\nWavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum. Source: (Tempfli et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n\nRadiation (usually from the sun) is reflected by an object and this reflected energy is then detected by a remote sensor. However, there are several processes that affect and transform this energy due to interactions with the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere before the energy reaches the sensor. In many cases, scattering of radiation in the atmosphere requires image correction before the data can be used. This process is covered in Section 3.1.\n\n\n\nSurface and atmospheric interactions of radiation.

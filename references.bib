  abstract = {Phenologic events which may be related to yields of economic plant species in humid and sub-humid temperate regions are difficult and expensive to observe and measure. Sequential multispectral reflectance data obtained by an orbiting satellite (LANDSAT-1) over 14 preselected sites in central and eastern United States during a 14-month period were examined. Analysis of data from four reflectance bands (0.5 to 1.1 μm) indicated that foliage color, leaf senescence, and regrowth differences among hardwood timber stands can be detected and quantified. The results suggest the need for continued development of these monitoring techniques for use in detecting and quantifying conditions of economic plants which may affect yield.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing, geographic information systems, and modeling have combined to produce a virtual explosion of growth in ecological investigations and applications that are explicitly spatial and temporal. Of all remotely sensed data, those acquired by Landsat sensors have played the most pivotal role in spatial and temporal scaling. Modern terrestrial ecology relies on remote sensing for modeling biogeochemical cycles and for characterizing land cover, vegetation biophysical attributes, forest structure, and fragmentation in relation to biodiversity. Given the more than 30-year record of Landsat data, mapping land and vegetation cover change and using the derived surfaces in ecological models is becoming commonplace. In this article, we summarize this large body of work, highlighting the unique role of Landsat. © 2004 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

  abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Four digital change detection algorithms are applied to 1986 and 1990 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of a portion of the Salt Lake Valley area to determine the land-cover/land-use changes between the two dates. Image differencing and image regression are used with the six reflective TM bands to create 12 change images. A tassled cap transformation is also used to create three change images (change in brightness, greenness, and wetness). A new method-a Chi square transformation-is proposed and used with the six reflective bands to create a single band change image. A thresholding strategy is applied to the change images to separate the pixels of change from those of no change. Five hundred eighty-five samples are selected through a combination of stratified random sampling and systematic sampling procedure. Ground truth information on the sample sites is obtained from the interpretation of color aerial photo slides of the two dates. Three indices are used to assess the accuracies of the sixteen change images for land-cover/land-use change detection. The regression of TM Band 3 is found to be most accurate for detecting change vs. no change in all three indices, while the difference image of TM4 is found to be least accurate. The kind of change in land-cover/land-use is also examined. The results are compared and summarized. Changes involving construction sites and farmlands are found to be accurately detected by several change images. Four digital change detection algorithms are applied to 1986 and 1990 Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images of a portion of the Salt Lake Valley area to determine the land-cover/land-use changes between the two dates.

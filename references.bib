  abstract = {The study of land use and land cover change (LULC) is essential for the development of strategies, monitoring and control of the ecosystem. The present study aims to describe the dynamics of land cover and land use, and specially the impact of certain climatic parameters on the distribution of vegetation and land cover. For this study, multi-temporal remote sensing data are used to monitor land cover changes in Morocco, using a set of Landsat im-ages, including Landsat 7 (ETM+), Landsat 5 (TM), and Landsat 8 (OLI), captured during the period 2000–2020, those changes were determined by adopting the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method. The classification results show good accuracy values in the range of 90\% (2000), 80\% (2007), 82\% (2010), 93\% (2020). The LU/LC change detection showed a decrease of agricultural and forest areas in the order of 5\% between the year 2000 and 2020, and an increase of bare soil of 5\% to 6\%, and a notable change in urban area from 97.31 ha (0.03\%) in 2000 to 2988.2637 ha (0.82\%) in 2020. The overall results obtained from LULC show that the vegetation cover of the study area has undergone major changes during the study period. In order to monitor the vegetation status, an analysis of the precipitation-vegetation interaction is essential. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was determined from 2000 to 2020, to identify vegetation categories and quantify the vegetation density in the Lakhdar sub-basin. The obtained NDVI was analyzed using climatic index SPI (Normalized Precipitation Index) based on rainfall data from five stations. The correlation study between NDVI and SPI indices shows a strong linear relation between these two indicators especially while using an annual index SPI12 however, the use of NDVI index based on remote sensing provides a significant result while assessing vegetation. The results of our study can be used for vegetation monitoring and sustainable management of the area, since it is one of the largest basins in the country. © 2023, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE).

  abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme heat-health risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80\% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability. © 2012.},

A tassled cap transformation is also used to create three change images (change in brightness, greenness, and wetness). A new method-a Chi square transformation-is proposed and used with the six reflective bands to create a single band change image. A thresholding strategy is applied to the change images to separate the pixels of change from those of no change. Five hundred eighty-five samples are selected through a combination of stratified random sampling and systematic sampling procedure. Ground truth information on the sample sites is obtained from the interpretation of color aerial photo slides of the two dates. Three indices are used to assess the accuracies of the sixteen change images for land-cover/land-use change detection. The regression of TM Band 3 is found to be most accurate for detecting change vs. no change in all three indices, while the difference image of TM4 is found to be least accurate. The kind of change in land-cover/land-use is also examined. The results are compared and summarized. Changes involving construction sites and farmlands are found to be accurately detected by several change images.

NPS runoff from urban surfaces is now a leading threat to water quality and the percentage of impervious surface within a particular watershed has been recognized as a key indicator of the effects of non-point runoff and of future water and ecosystem quality. Although the effect of land use, population and impervious surface cover on water quality has been generally known for thirty years, a basic problem exists in quantifying the detailed spatial extent and distribution of various classes of impervious surface phenomena. Remote sensing technology has been one of the primary methods for acquiring data on the impervious areas of watersheds for tax assessment, mapping and modeling applications and continues to be one of the most promising technologies for providing detailed mapping information as input into watershed-level management decisions. This paper reviews the past use of remotely sensed data for impervious surface detection and analysis. It further explores the broader use of remote sensing technology in this area, including the potential for a new generation of instruments to improve the analysis of impervious surfaces.},

  abstract = {Background: Heatwaves present a significant health risk and the hazard is likely to escalate with the increased future temperatures presently predicted by climate change models. The impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and cities where populations are concentrated and where the climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area.Results: When looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the analysis identifies a concentration of "very high" risk areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of "high risk" areas scattered throughout the conurbation. Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a complicated picture with a considerable range of vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale.Conclusions: The results illustrate that a concentration of "very high" risk people live within the urban heat island, and this should be taken into account by urban planners and city centre environmental managers when considering climate change adaptation strategies or heatwave alert schemes. The methodology has been designed to be transparent and to make use of powerful and readily available datasets so that it can be easily replicated in other urban areas. © 2011 Tomlinson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Besides its applications in physical geography, such as run-off models and urban change studies, maps showing impervious surface distribution are essential for estimating socio-economic factors, such as population density and social conditions. In this paper, impervious surface distribution, together with vegetation and soil cover, is estimated through a fully constrained linear spectral mixture model using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data within the metropolitan area of Columbus, OH in the United States. Four endmembers, low albedo, high albedo, vegetation, and soil were selected to model heterogeneous urban land cover. Impervious surface fraction was estimated by analyzing low and high albedo endmembers. The estimation accuracy for impervious surface was assessed using Digital Orthophoto Quarterquadrangle (DOQQ) images. The overall root mean square (RMS) error was 10.6\%, which is comparable to the digitizing errors of DOQQ images. Results indicate that impervious surface distribution can be derived from remotely sensed imagery with promising accuracy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

A map of percent impervious surface with a standard error of 7.95\% was generated using a normalized spectral mixture analysis of July 2002 Landsat TM imagery. Our analysis indicates there is a strong linear relationship between LST and percent impervious surface for all seasons, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI is much less strong and varies by season. This result suggests percent impervious surface provides a complementary metric to the traditionally applied NDVI for analyzing LST quantitatively over the seasons for surface urban heat island studies using thermal infrared remote sensing in an urbanized environment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Remotely sensed imagery is ideally used to monitor and detect land cover changes that occur frequently in urban and peri-urban areas as a consequence of incessant urbanization. It is a lengthy process to convert satellite imagery into land cover map using the existing methods of manual interpretation and parametric image classification digitally. In this paper we propose a new method based on Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) to automate the process of mapping built-up areas. It takes advantage of the unique spectral response of built-up areas and other land covers. Built-up areas are effectively mapped through arithmetic manipulation of re-coded Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDBI images derived from TM imagery. The devised NDBI method was applied to map urban land in the city of Nanjing, eastern China. The mapped results at an accuracy of 92.6\% indicate that it can be used to fulfil the mapping objective reliably. Compared with the maximum likelihood classification method, the proposed NDBI is able to serve as a worthwhile alternative for quickly and objectively mapping built-up areas.},

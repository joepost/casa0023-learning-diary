## Summary {#sec-week7summary}

**Recap: what was covered in Classification I (Week 6)?**

[Week 6](week6.qmd) covers the basics of classification techniques in remote sensing, including distinguishing between supervised and unsupervised methods, and an example of different methods (ISODATA, SVM) and their application.

**What is covered in Classification II?**

This diary entry covers object based analysis and sub-pixel analysis, spatial cross-validation, and measures of accuracy for classification models.

## Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA)

Trains a model to classify images based on 'objects' - segments of pixels that have been grouped together as single entity. This compares with pixel-based analysis where each pixel is classified in isolation. There are two steps to OBIA:

1.  Segmentation: grouping the pixels together into discrete objects which should be defined by similar shape and spectral characteristics. Benz, Baatz and Schreier [-@benzOSCARobjectOrientedSegmentation2001] developed an early approach to segmentation specifically for remote sensing data, which aggregates similar pixels into segments while keeping the measured heterogeneity below a specified threshold. Heterogeneity is measured as a combination of both spectral and spatial characteristics - where spatial is further broken down into measures of *smoothness*Â and *compactness*.

2.  Classification: classify the segmented objects, using the same methods as would be used in a pixel-based analysis.

OBIA has advantages over pixel-based analysis in that the model is not restricted to spectral information; rather, the model also takes the pixel's context into account (i.e. through measures of shape).

## Sub-pixel Analysis

Estimating the fractions of certain land cover classes that make up a single pixel. Attempts to account for the fact that land cover (in reality) does not have discrete boundaries. Calculating sub-pixel values utilises *spectrally pure endmembers*.
